//! Single-instance guard (docs/resident-ingest.md §1) and the stale-lock
//! takeover that lets a service manager restart a killed daemon (§8).
//!
//! Two writers on one WAL database is the failure that corrupts data quietly,
//! so the daemon takes an exclusive lock *before* it opens the store.
//!
//! The mechanism is an atomically created lock file: `create_new(true)`, which
//! is `O_EXCL` on Unix and `CREATE_NEW` on Windows, with the same "fail if it
//! already exists" semantics on both. Deliberately **not** a file lock --
//! `flock` and `LockFileEx` disagree about advisory vs mandatory locking and
//! about what happens across processes, and §1 rules that out.
//!
//! The file carries the holder's pid and start time. It does not survive a
//! hard kill (nothing runs `Drop`), so a stale file is possible. Two facts
//! together decide whether a file on disk is a live lock or wreckage:
//!
//! 1. **The holder's heartbeat.** A running daemon re-stamps the file's
//!    modification time on a fixed cadence ([`HEARTBEAT`]); a file whose mtime
//!    has not moved for [`STALE_AFTER`] belongs to a process that is gone.
//!    This is a file observation, not a process check -- `kill(pid, 0)` is not
//!    portable and Unix reuses pids, which §5 already rules out for liveness.
//! 2. **The health file's `updated_at`** (§5), when the caller passes it: a
//!    daemon that is alive but wedged between lock heartbeats would still be
//!    visibly alive there, and stealing its lock would be the one mistake this
//!    module must not make.
//!
//! [`SingleInstance::acquire_or_recover`] uses both; plain
//! [`SingleInstance::acquire`] stays strict (fail on any existing file) and is
//! what `--maintenance` uses.
