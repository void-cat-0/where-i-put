//! Event observation: the appeared/disappeared timeline as an append-only JSONL
//! file (docs/resident-ingest.md §6).
//!
//! This is the evidence the v2 events table will be designed against, so it is
//! deliberately produced **without touching the schema**: nothing here talks to
//! `item-core`, and the whole timeline lives in a camera thread's memory until
//! it is written out.
//!
//! Three invariants:
//!
//! 1. **The file is an observation, not the truth.** When the v2 events table
//!    lands it becomes authoritative and this JSONL drops to a debugging
//!    artifact (§6). Nothing may read it back as state.
//! 2. **A lost event is better than a wrong one.** The in-memory table is keyed
//!    on the observation id: when the id changes under a key, that is reported
//!    as "the old one disappeared, a new one appeared" rather than guessed at.
//!    Coarser than reality, never false (the §6 drift note).
//! 3. **Writing must never take a camera down.** Every file operation here
//!    logs and continues; a rotation that cannot rename (Windows, a `tail`
//!    holding the file) simply leaves the log to grow until the next write.
//!
//! `covered` / `moved` are not produced: they need spatial relations (who
//! occluded whom, a container moving), which is v2 plus the rule engine. The
//! format accommodates them by keeping `event` a plain string rather than an
//! enum -- adding one costs no schema change and no change to this module.
