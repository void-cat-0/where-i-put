.SYNOPSIS
  Register the where-i-put resident ingest daemon as a Windows scheduled task.

.DESCRIPTION
  §8.4's recommended Windows shape: Task Scheduler, no external service
  wrapper, no admin requirement for a logon-triggered task. The task runs the
  daemon under a console so the console control events (Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Break /
  console close / logoff / shutdown) reach the daemon's handlers -- those are
  Windows' only graceful stop path, and the daemon drains cameras on them.

  Restart-on-failure is configured to match §8's "two levels of supervision,
  each independent": Task Scheduler restarts the whole daemon, the daemon's
  own Supervisor restarts individual cameras. Neither is left to the other.

.PARAMETER ExePath
  Full path to item-ingest.exe. Defaults to the release build in this repo.

.PARAMETER ConfigPath
  Full path to the deployment's config.toml.

.PARAMETER TaskName
  Task name to register under. Default: where-i-put ingest.

.PARAMETER AtStartup
  Start at system boot instead of user logon. Requires an elevated shell and a
  service account that can read the camera.

.EXAMPLE
  # Register for the current user, starting at logon:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy\install-windows-task.ps1 `
      -ExePath C:\where-i-put\item-ingest.exe `
      -ConfigPath C:\where-i-put\config.toml

.EXAMPLE
  # Remove it again:
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy\install-windows-task.ps1 -Unregister
#>
